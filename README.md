# epimeter
epimeter is a tool that determines how similar a given neo-epitope is to the  human proteome by calculating the distance between the peptide sequences.  epimeter has two functions: "index" and "query." The "index" function takes a FASTA file of proteins as an input and indexes all of the protein k-mers (user specifies k) into an Annoy Index. The "query" function then allows the user to search for a specific neo-epitope candidate within the Annoy Index allowing for a much more stream-lined and efficient search process than  current bioinformatics search tools such as BLAST.
