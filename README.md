# epimeter
epimeter is a tool that determines how similar a given neo-epitope is to the  human proteome by calculating the distance between the peptide sequences. epimeter has two functions: "index" which indexes kmers in a protein FASTA file into an Annoy Index and "query" which allows the user to search for a specific neo-epitope candidate within the Annoy Index.
